                        The website is using APIs from Flickr and Tumblr to manage the content.
                        Using third party APIs for website content is a simple way to manage content in a website.
                        The photos from Flickr are taken by me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Developed with NodeJS, the website is built by collecting all the content and then publishing flat html files.
                        A systemctl service on rasbperry pi server regulary pulls the master branch from a GIT repository and runs this build and deploy.
